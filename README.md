# Legal-ease

This software is provided devoid of warranty and license; "do what thou wilt".

# Abstract

ScalpL *will be* an engine for expressing arbitrarily intricate policies for
placement and removal of offers in asset exchanges; currently, it is hardcoded
as a market maker.

# Exchanges

Three Bitcoin exchanges are supported: [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com),
[BTC-e](https://www.btc-e.com), and [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com). More are
in the works.

# Documentation

Full documentation currently takes the form of idiosyncratic tangled lisp
source; translating this to natural language is a slow process, second in
priority to further development of the application itself. Stay tuned.

# Excuses and Explanations

* Kevin Simler's [article about
wealth](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/wealth-the-toxic-byproduct/), and Christ
Stucchio's [HFT
Apology](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html), form the
ideological and technical basis for ScalpL;

* Peter Seibel's [book about
Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html) lays out the
determining factors in the unconventional language choice; and

* Timothy B Lee's [cards](http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin) can
act as an executive summary of the Bitcoin phenomenon, although familiarity with
it is not necessary for this project.
