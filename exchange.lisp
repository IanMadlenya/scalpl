;;; this function should return two values:
;;; first and foremost - the vwab price
;;; it can get consed & pushed onto the basis list outside, by the worker
;;; second - the remaining basis for the consumed asset
;;; which also gets inserted into the bases set by the worker
;;; when there's no basis to be consumed, or insufficient, 2nd value nil
;;; does EXACTLY what we need!

;;; who calls this function?
;;; execution-worker, to compute the remaining basis for the given asset
;;; ope-spreader (TODO), to check whether a certain offer is profitable

;;; what should it be fed?
;;; bases - does it need both given and taken, or just given?
;;; pÃ—aq - this looks suspiciously familiar...............
